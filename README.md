# hubot-scripts

Developed by Dave Shea, http://www.mezzoblue.com/

Probably the least important repo ever, this is just a way to share some of
the simple hubot scripts I've built that I find useful. Maybe you will too.

hubot requires a live server plus an integration into a chat app like Slack or
HipChat, so the barrier to entry is a bit high on this. If you're feeling 
adventurous, here are a few starting points:

* https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/heroku.md
* https://github.com/tinyspeck/hubot-slack/blob/master/README.md
